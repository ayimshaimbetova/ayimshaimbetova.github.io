                            <p>The Lady of the Lake is a narrative poem by Sir Walter Scott, 
                            first published in 1810. Set in the Trossachs region of Scotland, 
                            it is composed of six cantos, each of which concerns the action of 
                            a single day.[1] There are voluminous antiquarian notes. The poem 
                            has three main plots: the contest among three men, Roderick Dhu, 
                            James Fitz-James, and Malcolm Graeme, to win the love of Ellen Douglas; 
                            the feud and reconciliation of King James V of Scotland and James Douglas; 
                            and a war between the Lowland Scots (led by James V) and the Highland 
                            clans (led by Roderick Dhu of Clan Alpine). The poem was tremendously 
                            influential in the nineteenth century, and inspired the Highland Revival</p>

                            <p>They say that the one who falls asleep under the figs will be dragged away by the devils. But that summer I didn't want to think about it. I rehearsed a lot, wrote songs, loved my Saika and dreamed of worldwide fame. That summer the wind smelled of earth and honeysuckle blossoms. That summer I died. An ordinary joke, a harmless prank that very soon turned into the worst nightmare. I did not want to believe in the reality of what was happening. But when my death became public domain, and my songs began to play on the radio, I realized that I was no longer able to change anything. I stood in the dark, surrounded by ghosts and otherworldly beings, and could not go out to people. And the black guide dogs, the servants of Hecate, came for me, because I myself did not go to the afterlife ...

Terrified at the notion of her absence, the Phantom enacts a plan to keep Christine by his side, while Raoul tries to foil the scheme.</p>
